1. [Idiom](https://clinicaltrials.gov)/Concept
   - `Construct validity`. `Harmonic series`, much like metaphysics, is a rich conceptual foundation because “stacking” is intrinsic to it; chord stacking
   - Four-base purine code of DNA & RNA is similarly suited for genes
      - Gene sequences
   - Alphabet too allows stacking into words
      - Word phrases
   - Unlike fractals, purines, alphabetes, the harmonic series are "convergent"
      - Symmetry is absent
   - Well-tempered keyboard tuning is an artifice
      - Brings out dance from shackles
        
3. Adjective/Rx
4. Language/Trial
5. Subject/Disease
6. `Verb`/Followup
   - `Activation` implied by verb `to do`
      - Modification of affect by tone-painting
8. Object/Efficacy
