- `Harmonic series`, much like metaphysics, is a rich conceptual foundation because “stacking” is intrinsic to it
  - Chord stack
- Four-base purine code of DNA & RNA is similarly suited for genes
  - Gene sequences
- Alphabet too allows stacking into words
  - Word phrases
- Unlike fractals, purines, alphabetes, the harmonic series are "convergent"
  - Symmetry is absent
- Well-tempered keyboard tuning is an artifice
  - Brings out dance from shackles
- `Activation` implied by verb `to do`
  - Modification of affect by tone-painting
